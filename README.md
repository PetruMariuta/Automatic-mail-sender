# Automatic-mail-sender

!!For this program to work, you will need to to modify a setting in your gmail so that the keys pressed py the program will work as intended.  

Gmail>Settings>Show All Settings>Enable Shortcuts.

This will enable keys such as "c" to compose an email.

My web browser is chrome so to acces it i used chrome_path='C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s' , if you want to use another browser,insert the path to you desired browser application instead, or use  webbrowser.open("url") to use the default one.
